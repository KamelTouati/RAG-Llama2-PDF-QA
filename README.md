# RAG-Llama2 PDF QA

This repository implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application using **Llama2** for **PDF-based question answering**. The system extracts information from PDF documents, enabling users to ask questions and retrieve accurate answers using an open-source model.

## Overview

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an approach to natural language processing that combines the strength of retrieval systems with generation models like Llama2. In this application, users can upload PDFs, ask questions, and receive answers directly from the content of the PDF.

This project utilizes Llama2, an open-source model, and implements RAG to improve the relevance and accuracy of the answers.

## Features

- **PDF Parsing:** Extract text from PDF documents.
- **Question Answering:** Submit questions and receive contextually accurate answers.
- **Llama2 Integration:** Leverage the power of the Llama2 model for text generation and understanding.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Efficiently retrieves relevant document chunks before generating answers.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Ready for further model fine-tuning and scaling.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` or `conda` for package management

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KamelTouati/RAG-Llama2-PDF-QA.git
cd RAG-Llama2-PDF-QA
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Llama2 Model

Ensure you have the necessary Llama2 model files downloaded or integrated using Hugging Face or any other model hosting platform. Update the model path in the configuration file as needed.

## Usage

1. **Upload PDF:** Upload a PDF document for processing.
2. **Ask a Question:** Query the system using natural language questions.
3. **Retrieve Answers:** Get accurate answers based on the contents of the uploaded PDF.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Parsing:** PDFs are ingested, and text is extracted and chunked.
2. **Retrieval System:** The RAG framework retrieves the most relevant document chunks based on the question.
3. **Answer Generation:** Llama2 generates answers based on the retrieved chunks.

## Future Improvements

- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Adapt the Llama2 model to domain-specific PDF content.
- **Multi-PDF Support:** Enable the system to handle multiple PDFs simultaneously.
- **UI Integration:** Develop a web-based or CLI interface for easier interaction.
- **Performance Optimization:** Improve response times and memory usage for large PDFs.
